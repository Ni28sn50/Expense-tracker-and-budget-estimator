# Expense-tracker-and-budget-estimator
Expense are daily part of our life and we all spend our money in different sectors of life. It can be food expense , travel expense, clothing expense , house expense, vacation expenses etc., In order , we can see expenses are happening daily , so we can’t have all the records present every time in our memory , we will always miss out something and it will lead to information loss and we can’t track our expenses.

Budget estimation is also very important for people to know where they have spent and on what things. It helps them to cut off least important things and save their money .
 
There is always a relationship between expense and budget , both depended on each other.
Therefore , it is always important to have an expense tracker and budget estimator to have a record always present with us. 
This project is based on the same idea of expense and budget. Therefore , project has its name as “EXPENSE TRACKER AND BUDGET ESTIMATOR.”.
